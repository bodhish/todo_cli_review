      <h1>Solution guide for the Todo CLI problem</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! We looked at over three thousand code submissions for the
        CoronaSafe Engineering Fellowship program and discovered a few patterns
        that are &ldquo;low hanging fruits&rdquo; - things that bring in huge
        benefits, but are surprisingly easy to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        But first - if you want to see the kind of code we&rsquo;re looking for,
        <a
          href="https://gist.github.com/jasim/99c7b54431c64c0502cfe6f677512a87"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >please check out this solution to the Todo CLI challenge</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The above solution passes all the automated tests and will take an
        experienced programmer only about an hour to write. Please compare it
        with your code submission and see where they differ.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following sections we explain the reasoning behind the structure
        of this sample solution.
      </p>
      <h1>What is &ldquo;good code&rdquo;, and why is it important?</h1>
      <p>
        There is a counter-intuitive thing in how long it takes to write code:
        we often think we can go faster if we don&rsquo;t care about quality. It
        is wrong. You could be overall faster writing clean, considered programs
        than if you try to go quickly with a rush job. You just need to know the
        right techniques and have an understanding of what makes code
        &ldquo;good&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good code is easy to read and understand. It is well-formatted. It has a
        visual structure that is pleasing to the eye. It uses descriptive
        variable names, not too long, not too short. And it encodes the domain
        explicitly in code so those who read it can understand the nuances of
        the underlying problem it is trying to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software developers spend the majority of their lives in front of a
        computer - writing, reading, and changing code. The codebase they work
        on is their home. If the codebase is convoluted and messy, their lives
        are difficult. If the codebase is clean and elegant, programming is a
        joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is your cue as a student who wants to enter the industry in the
        next few years. Learn to write good, pleasing code that your fellow
        programmers find simple to understand, and you&rsquo;re already miles
        ahead in your pursuit of a rewarding career as a software engineer.
      </p>

        programmers write code that humans can understand.&rdquo; &mdash; Martin
        Fowler
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us look at some of the problematic patterns that we found in the
        code submissions, and how you can fix them.
      </p>
      <p>The problems are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Poor aesthetics - code that fails the squint test</li>
        <li>Short unintelligible variable names</li>
        <li>Interleaving I/O with computation</li>
        <li>Suboptimal programming language choice</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>1. Poor aesthetics / failing the squint test</h2>
      <p>
        When we were reviewing the submissions for the Todo CLI challenge, we
        could say how good a solution was within a few seconds of seeing it on
        screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can too.
        <strong
          >Code that looks clean, easy to scan, and overall visually appealing
          is likely to be good. But code that looks messy wouldn&rsquo;t
          probably be that great.</strong

      </p>
      <p>
        Take a quick look at this piece of code - just glance at it, don&rsquo;t
        try understanding what it does:
      </p>
      <pre>
  <code class="language-python">
if os.path.isfile('todo.txt'):
    with open('todo.txt', 'r') as todoFileOri:
        data = todoFileOri.readlines()
    ct = len(data)
    if num > ct or num <= 0:
        sys.stdout.buffer.write('Error: todo #{} does not exist.'.format(num).encode('utf8'
                                ))
    else:
        with open('todo.txt', 'w') as todoFileMod:
            if os.path.isfile('done.txt'):
                with open('done.txt', 'r') as doneFileOri:
                    doneData = doneFileOri.read()
                with open('done.txt', 'w') as doneFileMod:
                    for line in data:
                        if ct == num:
                            doneFileMod.write('x '
                                    + datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'
                                    ) + ' ' + line)
                        else:
                            todoFileMod.write(line)
                        ct -= 1
                    doneFileMod.write(doneData)
            else:
                with open('done.txt', 'w') as doneFileMod:
                    for line in data:
                        if ct == num:
                            doneFileMod.write('x '
                                    + datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'
                                    ) + ' ' + line)
                        else:
                            todoFileMod.write(line)
                        ct -= 1
        sys.stdout.buffer.write('Marked todo #{} as done.'.format(num).encode('utf8'
                                ))
else:
    sys.stdout.buffer.write('Error: todo #{} does not exist.'.format(num).encode('utf8'
                            ))

      <p>
        An experienced programmer will see this code and immediately realize
        that the control flow is nested and tangled up. It will take us some
        moments to read through it and understand what it is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, take a look at this code sample, which is completely unrelated to
        the Todo CLI problem. Just glance at it - you shouldn&rsquo;t try to
        read and understand what it is doing:
      </p>
      <pre>
  <code class="language-pascal">
{$S SegPaste }
PROCEDURE CenterScrap(VAR r: Rect);
{ Center scrap rectangle in current window.     }
{ Exit fatBits if rect is too wide or too tall. }
VAR width,height: INTEGER;
    windRect:   Rect;
    saveGrid:   BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  saveGrid := toolGrid;
  toolGrid := TRUE;
  width := r.right - r.left;
  height := r.bottom - r.top;

  IF (width > 48) OR (height > 30) THEN  { won't fit in fatBits }
    BEGIN
      fatFlag := FALSE;
      CheckItem(myMenus[aidsMenu],fatItem,fatFlag);
    END;

  windRect := altBits.bounds;
  IF fatFlag THEN windRect := fatBits.bounds;
  WITH r DO
    BEGIN
      left := (windRect.left + windRect.right - width) DIV 2;
      top  := (windRect.top + windRect.bottom - height) DIV 2;
      IF NOT fatFlag THEN GridPoint(topLeft);  { dont let fat get off screen }
      right := left + width;
      bottom := top + height;
    END;

  toolGrid := saveGrid;
END;
  </code>
</pre>
      <p>
        Take a glance at both code samples and see which one feels more elegant.
        Which one of them looks like someone spent time on it lovingly polishing
        every letter of it?
      </p>
      <p>
        That - how you feel about a code&rsquo;s appearance at a quick glance -
        that is the squint test.
      </p>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s try to unpack it a bit.</p>
      <p>
        The first code snippet is written in Python - it is quite good, make no
        mistake. It executes correctly, passes the automated tests, and has used
        descriptive variable names.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second code snippet is written in Pascal, an old venerable
        programming language. It is part of MacPaint, which was released in 1984
        for the original Macintosh computer. It is one of the earliest digital
        painting applications, a precursor to the MS-Paint of modern times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the two, the older Pascal program would pass the &ldquo;squint
        test&rdquo; for an experienced programmer. But
        <a
          href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/macpaint-and-quickdraw-source-code/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >MacPaint is, in Prof. Donald Knuth&rsquo;s opinion, &ldquo;the best
          program ever written&rdquo;</a
        >, and so the comparison is not totally fair.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point here is that irrespective of which language we use, and how
        old or new the code is, the &ldquo;squint test&rdquo; is timeless. If
        you can briefly glance at a piece of program and enjoy its visual
        elegance, then it is likely better than code that doesn&rsquo;t pass the
        squint test. Even if both code snippets work the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Code that doesn&rsquo;t pass the squint test is an automatic rejection
        during most programming interviews. It wouldn&rsquo;t even matter how
        fast your code is, unless that is the only criterion in which it is
        judged - like in an algorithms challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when some code passes the squint test, then it means that its
        internal structure is also probably good. Think of bananas. If the outer
        skin has brown spots, then it is very likely that it is overripe and not
        probably good to eat. But if the skin looks fresh and spotless, then the
        banana is almost always good inside as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aesthetics matter. What we see on the surface - messy or clean - it will
        reflect in the program&rsquo;s deeper structure as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if we have to improve our craft as programmers, we should strive to
        write code that is elegant and pleasing to the eye. But how?
      </p>
      <h3>1. Use an automatic code formatter</h3>
      <p>
        Setup your editor so that every time you save the code, the auto
        formatter runs and cleans up your code. It will line up the spaces
        inside expressions, sometimes split long lines, and indents code so that
        the control flow is clear to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Automatic code formatting can be setup within a minute, it is such an
        easy way to magically improve your perceived ability as a programmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don&rsquo;t already have it set up, then you must stop everything
        you&rsquo;re doing and go set it up immediately!

        2. Use descriptive variable names, but keep it short depending on
        context.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Paraphrased from the excellent
        <a
          href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/files-modules-and-programs.html#design-for-the-call-site"
          target="_blank"

      </p>
      <p>
        You can improve readability by choosing good names for your functions,
        variant tags and record fields. Good names aren&rsquo;t always long, to
        be clear. If you wanted to write an anonymous function for doubling a
        number: (fun x -&gt; x * 2), a short variable name like x is best. A
        good rule of thumb is that names that have a small scope should be
        short, whereas names that have a large scope, like the name of a
        function in a module interface, should be longer and more explicit.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is of course a tradeoff here, in that making your APIs more
        explicit tends to make them more verbose as well. Another useful rule of
        thumb is that more rarely used names should be longer and more explicit,
        since the cost of concision and the benefit of explicitness become more
        important the more often a name is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, if you want to lean towards one side, then please always err
        on the side of descriptive variable names rather than short
        unintelligible mnemonics.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. Keep control flow linear, minimize conditional branching, and avoid
        nesting.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Remember that these are only guidelines - not all problems can be made
        linear nor can their nesting be avoided. But for most problems -
        including things like the Todo CLI application, it is very much
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your first instincts when writing code should be to avoid unnecessary
        branching and deep nesting. If the problem however resists that attempt,
        then it is okay - some complexity is irreducible. But don&rsquo;t leave
        without giving it a try.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way of achieving this is to use &ldquo;early returns&rdquo;. For
        example, if your method cannot work if a file doesn&rsquo;t exist, then
        check for it in the beginning, and return immediately if the check
        fails.
      </p>
      <p>eg, instead of:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-python">
def markDone(num):
if os.path.isfile('todo.txt'):
    # actual code
else:
    # print error
    return
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>We can write:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-python">
def markDone(num):
if not os.path.isfile('todo.txt'):
  # print error
  return
# actual code
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        This way the rest of the code is linear and we don&rsquo;t have the
        mental overhead of keeping track of the nesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to make the narrative of the code clearer is to use what
        I&rsquo;d call the &ldquo;mise-en-place&rdquo; approach to arranging
        code inside a function. In cooking, it means &ldquo;put in place&rdquo;
        - gather and arrange all the ingredients needed, before we turn on the
        stove.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can apply it in programming in this manner - a function should setup
        all the data it needs in the beginning of its body, and not intersperse
        it into the actual computation code.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if it needs data from a file or a response from a network request,
        then it should run all of them first and store into appropriate
        variables, and only then do the computation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, see the
        <a
          href="https://gist.github.com/jasim/99c7b54431c64c0502cfe6f677512a87#file-todo_cli_coronasafe-js-L114"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >cmdMarkDone() function in the sample Todo CLI code</a
        >. It validates the argument, reads the data, and sets everything up
        first. Then the computation code is free of any distractions and is
        clear to read.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Do not interleave I/O with computation</h3>
      <p>
        The earlier point leads directly here. I/O stands for input and output -
        that includes getting user input through the keyboard or mouse, reading
        and writing to files, network requests, database reads and writes, even
        printing things to screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these things should sit in the boundary of our system, and the inner
        core should be just pure computation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This concept is called &ldquo;functional core, imperative shell&rdquo;,
        and is explained in great detail by
        <a
          href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell"

      </p>
      <h3>5. Suboptimal choice of programming language</h3>
      <p>
        Emacs and Vim are two of the most powerful text editors in the world.
        They have different philosophies about text editing, but in their own
        ways, they both have great utility.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, using either of these editors will not magically make any of us
        better at text editing. In fact - it is likely that you will become
        worse at it if you pick these tools. It is the same for a lot of
        advanced tools: they have a steep learning curve and until you master
        them, you will be less productive than people using conventional tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the mobile phone camera versus a DSLR. If you don&rsquo;t know
        anything about photography, a phone camera is your best choice.
        It&rsquo;ll let you take high-quality pictures without having to spend
        much time figuring it out. But if you use an advanced, flexible device
        like a DSLR, then you need to know photography well to take good
        pictures. Otherwise the photos you take with them could be worse than
        photos taken by an amateur photographer on their cheaper, automatic
        phone cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
        This applies to your choice of programming language as well. The Todo
        list CLI application is a high-level programming problem and can be
        easily solved with high-level languages like Python and JavaScript. They
        have excellent standard libraries that are well-documented, making many
        of the common programming operations very easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to these high-level languages, the C programming language is
        much more powerful - it lets you write code that can manually manage the
        memory and invoke system calls directly. If you were writing low-level
        software like an operating system kernel, or a database engine, then C
        &amp; C++ are well-suited for them. But if you are trying to solve a
        problem like the Todo CLI - then you have to be really good at C to
        compete against a programmer who&rsquo;s just passable at a high-level
        programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, if you want to solve an algorithmic or systems-level
        problem, then by all means use C and C++. But if it is a high-level
        problem, then use a high-level language with a rich standard library.
        This way you can focus on the domain rather than worrying about
        low-level primitives that are unnecessary in that context.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you only know C, then it is high-time you also picked up a
        high-level programming language to use as your daily driver.

        In &ldquo;Out of the tar pit&rdquo;, Moseley and Marks describe two
        kinds of complexity: Essential and Accidental. While we cannot do
        anything about the essential complexity, they argue, we should keep the
        accidental complexity in a system to the minimum. In the first part of
        the paper where they describe the problem is lucid and timeless. In the
        second part they propose a solution to this problem, and you can safely
        skip that section if you want to.

        Another article you might find insightful is the 1985 paper by Peter
        Naur titled &ldquo;Programming as Theory Building&rdquo;. In it he
        explains that all large programs have a theory behind it. If you are one
        of its original authors, then you shaped that theory. So if in the
        future you want to make a change to the system, you can confidently do
        it. This is because you know why the codebase is organized in that
        specific manner, so whatever change you do will be coherent with its
        internal design. A new programmer would only see the surface level code
        and will not be able to figure out exactly what to change, what to
        extend, or what to remove to accommodate a new feature. Great codebases
        go to great pains to make this theory obvious to everyone, so it can
        continue to evolve without being bottlenecked on its original designers.

      <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        I hope this gives you a starting point to learn more about writing good
        code. You don&rsquo;t have to thoroughly understand everything said in
        this post. You just need to read and immerse in the ideas described here
        so over time they will seep into your mind and finally click into place
        when you encounter the right situation.
